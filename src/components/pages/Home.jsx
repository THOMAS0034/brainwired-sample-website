            at an affordable rate. Our team has a passion for making things with real value. This has
            led us to assemble a multi-talented group that can do just about anything. We believe in
            creating a brand through strategy, story-telling, products, and integrated experiences on web,
             mobile, and in the world. So that we become a household name among Indian farmers becoming a
