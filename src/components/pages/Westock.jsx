                WeSTOCK is committed to revolutionizing livestock health management by offering the most affordable and accessible healthcare solutions in the world. Our system harnesses the power of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) to continuously monitor the physiological and behavioral parameters of animals. By analyzing real-time data collected from wearable sensors, WeSTOCK can detect early signs of illness, stress, or abnormal activity patternsâ€”often before visible symptoms appear. This proactive approach enables timely intervention, reducing the risk of severe diseases and improving overall animal well-being.

                WeSTOCKâ€™s advanced Activity Monitoring system plays a vital role in safeguarding livestock health by keeping a close watch on their daily behavior and routines. Using precision sensors and intelligent algorithms, the system tracks key metrics such as feeding habits, drinking patterns, rumination time, mobility, and resting behavior. These parameters provide deep insights into the well-being of each animal, helping farmers identify deviations that may indicate stress, illness, or discomfort.

               Accurate tracking of the heat cycle is essential for optimizing reproduction and ensuring higher pregnancy success rates in dairy and beef cattle. WeSTOCK uses advanced motion sensors and behavioral analytics to monitor subtle signs of estrus such as restlessness, increased movement, reduced feed intake, and mounting behavior â€” indicators that often go unnoticed in manual observation.
